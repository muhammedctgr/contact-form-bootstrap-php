<h2>Requirements</h2>
The server side script is in PHP. So you should have a working PHP setup on the webserver.
<p>
The script is tested working with PHP 5.4 and above (including PHP 7 )
</p>

<li>Open the file named "handler.php" <br/> Look for <code>sendEmailTo</code> add the email addresses to receive the form submissions.</li>
<li>Upload this <strong>whole folder</strong> to your website</li>

Once you have the form working you can tweak it to your needs. Feel free to edit the form.css or form.js files to customize and make it work better for you.
